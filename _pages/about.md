Hello, I'm Jakub,
How fortunate of you to have landed here. Careful where you go from here, you can expect this space to be at times very serious or just a little too silly. 

I'm a passionate gamer, I've touched every genre and strive to compete at the hardest difficulty. One minute
you'll find me assembling tiles in Dorfromantik to relaxing low-fi music, while the next I'll be crunching numbers in
Path of Exile or pushing high Ascension in Slay the Spire. I can't answer how this intensity hasn't burned me out over the years...
I love what I do and I want to do more of it.

When I put on my serious face, I'm a Software Developer who'd currently undergoing seasoning at Oracle. I specialize in putting my hands on
big and scary trouble piles that other engineers would rather ignore. While not always glamorous, whenever I'm successful, I ride a high so
pleasant that it silences my existencial dread for a good while.
